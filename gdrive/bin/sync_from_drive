# Some extra care needs to be taken figuring out the folder to sync because
# 'gdrive sync upload ...' creates sync folders whose name does not include
# the full path, just the base folder name, and there is no '--absolute'
# flag to 'gdrive sync list' nor is there a '--name' argument to 'sync upload'
#
# For these reasons, 'sync_from_drive' requires an existing local folder
# whose name matches that of the sync folder name and with a .folderid
# that matches the sync folder id. Run 'getfolderids' prior to 'sync_from_drive'.
